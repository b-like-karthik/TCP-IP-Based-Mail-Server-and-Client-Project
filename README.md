# TCP-IP-Based-Mail-Server-and-Client-Project

You can run mailclient.c file on one machine and other two files on other machine.

After compiling poperver.c and smtpmail.c, execute them by giving port numbers as command line argument (EX: ./popserver 20000)

For mailclient.c give srever IP address (IP address of the machine in which the server is running) and port numbers as command line argument while executing it. 

Now the program will direct you.
